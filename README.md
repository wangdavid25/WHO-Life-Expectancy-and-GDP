# WHO Life Expectancy and GDP
__Objective__

 Using the GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to identify the correlation between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

__Data__

This dataset collected from the World Health Organization and the World Bank is stored as a CSV file.It includes 6 countries: Chile (South America), China (Asia), Germany (Europe), Mexico (North America), USA (North America), and Zimbabwe (Africa). The dataset is information from 2000 to 2015 and includes Country, Year, Life Expectancy, and GDP. There are no missing data for any country.

__Analysis__

We will be treating GDP as the independent variable and life expectancy as the dependent variable. We will examine the following:
    -Average life expectancy per country
    -Average GDP per country
    -GDP over time trends
    -Life expectancy over time trends
    -Correlation between life expectancy and GDP

__Conclusion__

From our analysis we see that there is strong positive correlation between GDP of each country and life expectancy from birth. The GDP and life expectancy had a positive trend over the 15 years in the observed dataset. This lends to provide support that the two factors have a positive linear relationship. We also observed that year to year fluctuations does not impact life expectancy drastically. Looking at the average total GDP and average life expectancies from birth over the 15 years, it is apparent that the highest average GDP does not correspond to the highest average life expectancy from birth, even when the average total GDP is very large, such as for USA. This many be due to other factors that we could investigate further. This leads us to believe that many other factors should be looked at to fully understand life expectancies in countries.

__Further Actions__ <br />
Other factors to consider may include:

    -GDP per capita
    -Leading causes of death by country
    -A larger sample including more country and longer timeline
    -Countries major industries 
    -Social and Political issues in the country
    -Education levels by Country
